## INTRODUCTION

Hello, I'm Mike.  This project marks the culmination of my Google Business Intelligence Professional Certification course.

**Scenario:**

During my interview for a Business Intelligence (BI) position on the Google Fiber call center team, I am tasked with creating a dashboard tool. This tool will enable the team to analyze trends related to repeat calls. Specifically, they want to understand how frequently customers contact customer support after their initial inquiry. The goal is to assess the team's effectiveness in addressing customer questions during the first interaction.
